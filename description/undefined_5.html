			On the Meadow Murmeliwiese, next to Bachtobelstrasse  above  Schweighofstrasse there is a good site so spot the bats living in the forest of the &Uuml;etliberg.<br/><br/>
			In the evening they leave the forest and come to the meadow grounds for hunting insects.<br/><br/>
			Its a bat site only known by the locals, that's why not so many bats have actually been recorded as you can see on the hotspot map.<br/><br/>
