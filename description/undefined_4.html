			Research studies have shown that  Daubenton’s bat, which are living in tree holes on top of the hill Hönggerberg, follow  the river Bombach to reach their hunting grounds at the river Limmat.<br/><br/>
			Follow this picturesque stream from the forest on top of the hill to the river Limmat, and spot these marvellous species.<br/><br/>
			The Regensdorferstrasse crossing is the most risky part of their route as there are tall trees having canopy and so the bats are crossing the road close to the floor.<br/><br/>
