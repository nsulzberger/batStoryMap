			The Polyterrasse next to the ETH and University of Zurich is a popular viewpoint where you can enjoy a nice sunset over the old town of Zurich, the &Uuml;etliberg and the Limmattal.<br/><br/>
			And itâ€™s quite good to enjoy some common types of bats on a warm summer evening.<br/><br/>
			But they are not so common there compared to other sites described, as you can see on the hotspot map.
