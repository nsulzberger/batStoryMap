			This place is best known in Zurich for bat watching, there are even bat detectors installed so you can listen to the chatting of these amazing species.<br/><br/>
			Before it gets darker you’ll first spot swifts, afterwards  noctule bats will join in for hunting insects.<br/><br/>
			A bit later you’ll be able to watch common and Nathusiu’s pipistrelle. They are hunting over the fishermans path (Limmatuferweg) around the trees and in the tree tunnel next to the blue suspension bridge.<br/><br/>
			Daubenton’s bat prefer hunting along the quiet flowing canal on the other side of the river island. You can spot them easily at the bridge with help of a bright torch.<br/><br/>
