			This place is best known in Zurich for bat watching, there are even bat detectors installed so you can listen to the chatting of these amazing species.<br/><br/>
			Before it gets darker you’ll first spot swifts, afterwards  noctule bats will join in for hunting insects.<br/><br/>
			Daubenton’s bat prefer hunting along the quiet flowing canal on this side of the island. You can spot them easily at the bridge with help of a bright torch.<br/><br/>
			A bit later you’ll be able to watch common and nathusiu’s pipistrelle. They are hunting over the fishermans path (Limmatuferweg) on the other side of the island around the trees and in the tree tunnel next to the blue suspension bridge.<br/><br/>
